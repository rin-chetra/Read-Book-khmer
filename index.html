              There are many reasons people should read. People should read because it helps them to improve in English. It helps them to be a better               reader and it helps people get better jobs. For these reasons people should read books.

         <p>
                  First of all, Reading helps people to learn English and improve in English. For example, there are many words we don’t know so when we                   read a book, we learn these words. 
         </p>
      <div>    
       <h2>March 6th <em>Book can watch and give to knowlege more than idea</em></h2>
         <p>
                       n addition, Reading helps people to get a better reader. For instance, in school you have to read better otherwise you can’t pass ESL or regents. Also reading is one way that helps you to write a better essay.

        <p>
                          when you read a book, it helps you to get new ideas and when you get new ideas you can use all these ideas and write a better essay.

       <p>
                       Reading helps you get a good job. For instance, if want to get a good job you have to read better because if you get good job there are many things you have to read aloud in front of other people so if you can’t read they are not going to hire you because you don’t know how to read

       <p>
                       In conclusion, I think reading is very important. We have to read otherwise we can’t succeed in the future. Reading is very important. If we don’t read  books we can’t learn better English, if we don’t learn English we can’t get better job. Many people think that reading is not so important. I think they should think more and then say this sentence.
